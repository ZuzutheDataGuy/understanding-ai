# Chapter 2: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most important technologies in the modern world. It is no longer limited to research laboratories, it is now used in everyday tools, industries, and services that people rely on daily. AI improves efficiency, accuracy, and decision making across many sectors [1].

## 2.1 Why Artificial Intelligence Matters

AI is important because it allows machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This creates opportunities to:

- Automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks  
- Reduce human error  
- Process large amounts of data quickly  
- Support better decision making  

Organizations use AI to improve productivity and innovation across industries [2].

## 2.2 Role of AI in Everyday Life

Many people interact with AI systems daily without noticing. Examples include:

- Voice assistants such as Siri and Google Assistant  
- Recommendation engines on platforms like Netflix and YouTube  
- Navigation systems that provide traffic predictions  
- Email spam and phishing filters  
- Face recognition used in smartphone security  

These tools make everyday tasks faster, safer, and more efficient [3].
