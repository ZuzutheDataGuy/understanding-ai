# Chapter 3: Key Concepts

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can process large amounts of data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and even adapt to new information.

**Key points:**
- AI is not a single technology but a collection of techniques and methods.
- AI aims to create machines capable of solving problems, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions autonomously.
- AI is used in everyday applications like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.

## Types of AI
AI can be categorized based on capability and functionality:

### 1. Based on Capability
- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Performs a specific task very well, e.g., chatbots, recommendation engines.
- **General AI (Strong AI):** Has human-level cognitive abilities and can perform any intellectual task a human can do (still theoretical).
- **Superintelligent AI:** Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all domains.

### 2. Based on Functionality
- **Reactive Machines:** Simple AI that reacts to inputs, e.g., IBM’s Deep Blue chess computer.
- **Limited Memory:** AI that can learn from past experiences, e.g., self-driving car systems.
- **Theory of Mind (Future AI):** Can understand emotions, beliefs, and intentions of others.
- **Self-Aware AI (Future AI):** Conscious AI with self-awareness (still hypothetical).

## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
AI often relies on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to perform complex tasks:

### Machine Learning (ML)
- ML is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- **Examples:** Spam email detection, product recommendations, predictive analytics.
- **Types of ML:**
  - **Supervised Learning:** Learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns by trial and error with feedback from the environment (e.g., game-playing AI).

### Deep Learning (DL)
- DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in large datasets.
- **Examples:** Image recognition, speech-to-text conversion, natural language processing.
- **Neural Networks:** Algorithms inspired by the human brain structure, capable of learning from vast amounts of data.

## Key Terms
- **Algorithm:** A set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.
- **Neural Network:** A computing system inspired by the human brain’s network of neurons.
- **Dataset:** A structured collection of data used to train and test AI models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language.
- **Computer Vision:** The field of AI that trains computers to interpret and process visual information from the world.
- **Robotics:** Machines designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously using AI.
