---

## A
**Algorithm**  
A step-by-step set of instructions used to solve a problem or perform a task.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
Machines programmed to simulate human intelligence, learning, reasoning, and decision-making.

---

## B
**Bias (AI Bias)**  
Unfair or incorrect outcomes produced by AI systems due to biased training data or design.

---

## C
**Computer Vision**  
A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information such as images and videos.

---

## D
**Dataset**  
A structured collection of data used to train and test AI systems.

**Deep Learning (DL)**  
A type of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to detect complex patterns in large datasets.

---

## E
**Explainable AI (XAI)**  
Techniques that make AI system decisions understandable to humans.

---

## F
**Fraud Detection**  
An AI application that identifies unusual or suspicious activities in financial systems.

---

## G
**General AI (Strong AI)**  
A theoretical AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do.

---

## H
**Hyperparameter**  
A parameter set before training a model that controls learning behavior, such as learning rate or number of layers.

---

## L
**Large Language Model (LLM)**  
An AI model trained on massive text data that can understand and generate human-like language.

---

## M
**Machine Learning (ML)**  
A branch of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve without explicit programming.

**Model**  
A trained AI system that processes data to make predictions or decisions.

---

## N
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
A branch of AI that enables machines to understand and generate human language.

**Neural Network**  
A computational system inspired by the human brain that learns patterns through layers of connected nodes.  
*Example: Used in image recognition or language translation.*

---

## O
**Overfitting**  
When a model learns training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data.  
*Example: A model memorizes noise instead of patterns.*

---

## P
**Preprocessing**  
The steps taken to clean and prepare data before training an AI model.

---

## R
**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
A learning method where an AI system learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

---

## S
**Supervised Learning**  
Machine learning using labeled data to train models.

**Unsupervised Learning**  
Machine learning that finds patterns in data without labeled outputs.

---

## T
**Training Data**  
Data used to teach an AI model how to perform a task.

**Transfer Learning**  
A technique where a model trained on one task is adapted to perform a related task.

---

## U
**Uncertainty**  
A measure of how confident a model is about its predictions.

---

## V
**Validation Data**  
A separate set of data used to evaluate a model’s performance during training.
