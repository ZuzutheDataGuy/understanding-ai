# Chapter 8: Glossary

This glossary provides clear, simple definitions of key terms used throughout this knowledge base on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Use this as a quick reference when reading other chapters.

---

## A

**Algorithm**  
A step-by-step set of instructions used to solve a problem or perform a task.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions.

---

## B

**Bias (AI Bias)**  
Unfair or incorrect outcomes produced by AI systems due to biased training data or design.

---

## C

**Computer Vision**  
A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information such as images and videos.

---

## D

**Dataset**  
A structured collection of data used to train and test AI systems.

**Deep Learning (DL)**  
A subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn complex patterns in large datasets.

---

## E

**Explainable AI (XAI)**  
Techniques that make AI system decisions easier for humans to understand.

---

## F

**Fraud Detection**  
An AI application that identifies unusual or suspicious activities in financial systems.

---

## G

**General AI (Strong AI)**  
A theoretical type of AI that would be capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do.

---

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**  
An AI model trained on massive amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like language.

---

## M

**Machine Learning (ML)**  
A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

**Model**  
A trained AI system that processes data and produces predictions or decisions.

---

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
A branch of AI that enables machines to understand and generate human language.

**Neural Network**  
A computational system inspired by the human brain that learns patterns through layers of connected nodes.

---

## O

**Overfitting**  
When a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

---

## R

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
A learning method where an AI system learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

---

## S

**Supervised Learning**  
A type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train models.

**Unsupervised Learning**  
A type of machine learning that finds patterns in data without labeled outputs.

---

## T

**Training Data**  
Data used to teach an AI model how to perform a task.

**Transfer Learning**  
A technique where a model trained on one task is adapted to perform a different but related task.
