# Chapter 3: Key Concepts

## 3.1 What is AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

AI systems can process large volumes of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on algorithms. This chapter introduces fundamental AI concepts and terminology to provide a foundation for deeper topics in later chapters.

**See Chapter 1** for an introduction to AI and its history.

## 3.2 Types of AI
AI can be categorized in several ways:

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Designed for a specific task, e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation systems.  
- **General AI (Strong AI):** Hypothetical AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can.  
- **Superintelligent AI:** A theoretical AI that surpasses human intelligence across all domains.

## 3.3 Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where machines learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.  
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

**Example:**  
- ML: Predicting whether an email is spam based on features like keywords.  
- DL: Image recognition in self-driving cars using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## 3.4 Key Concepts
- **Algorithm:** A set of rules a computer follows to solve a problem.  
- **Neural Network:** A computing system inspired by the human brain, used for tasks like image recognition and NLP.  
- **Dataset:** A collection of data used for training and testing AI models.  
- **Training:** The process of teaching an AI model using data.  
- **Supervised Learning:** Training with labeled data.  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Training with unlabeled data to find patterns.  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** AI learns by trial and error, receiving feedback from actions.

## 3.5 Applications of Key Concepts
- **Computer Vision:** Object detection, facial recognition.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Chatbots, sentiment analysis.  
- **Robotics:** Autonomous navigation, manipulation.  
- **Recommendation Systems:** E-commerce, streaming platforms.
