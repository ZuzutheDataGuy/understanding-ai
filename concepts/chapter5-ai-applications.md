## Top 3 AI application fields (most established + high impact)

1. **Enterprise productivity and automation (genAI + agentic AI)**  
   This is where adoption is exploding because AI is being embedded into everyday workflows like writing, analysis, customer support, and internal ops. McKinsey’s 2025 survey reports meaningful experimentation and early scaling of AI agents across enterprises, showing this is moving beyond pilots into real operational use.

2. **Healthcare and life sciences**  
   AI is now deeply tied to imaging support, clinical decision tools, and especially drug discovery and development. Recent 2024–2025 research and industry activity show sustained momentum and investment in AI-enabled drug pipelines.

3. **Manufacturing and industrial operations**  
   Predictive maintenance and computer-vision-based quality inspection remain among the clearest, ROI-driven uses of AI in physical industries. IBM’s overview highlights these as core, mature applications already improving uptime and defect detection.

## Emerging AI application fields (fast-growing, newer frontier)

1. **AI for scientific discovery and self-driving labs**  
   This combines AI with robotics to autonomously design, run, and refine experiments. It’s a major emerging frontier for materials, chemistry, and biomedical breakthroughs, flagged by global technology outlooks and supported by growing research momentum.

2. **AI for climate and clean energy systems**  
   Beyond forecasting, AI is increasingly used to optimize grids, reduce energy waste, and even improve exploration for cleaner energy sources like geothermal. Recent climate-policy and real-world examples show this shifting from concept to applied impact.
