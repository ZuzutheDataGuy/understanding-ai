## How We Used Git and GitHub

We used Git and GitHub to work as a team in an organized way.

- Each chapter was created in its own branch.
- We used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save and upload our work.
- Pull Requests (PRs) were opened for each chapter and reviewed by other team members.
- We used GitHub Issues to suggest improvements and track tasks.
- We merged approved PRs into the main branch.
- We used `git stash` when switching between unfinished tasks.
- We created and pushed a version tag (`v1.0`) once the project was completed.

## Challenges We Faced

During the project, we faced a few challenges:

- **Merge conflicts** when multiple edits happened in the same files(Chapter 6,7,8 had alot of conflicts to resolve).
- **Accidental reverts** of Chapter 7,8 which required multiple corrections.
- **Folder restructuring issues**, including renaming directories.
- Coordinating work across multiple branches without overwriting content.

These challenges were resolved through communication, careful reviews, and improved Git workflow discipline.

## Lessons Learned

From this project, we learned:

- How important clear commit messages are.
- How to work with branches safely.
- How to review teammates’ work properly.
- How to fix mistakes using Git.
- How collaboration works in real-life development projects.
- How to use Issues for suggestions and feedback

## Commit Message Style

We made sure our commit messages were clear and meaningful. Examples of messages we used:

- "Add Chapter 1: What is AI"
- "Update README formatting"
- "Fix formatting in Chapter 5"
- "Add resources and tools to Chapter 7"
- "Resolve merge conflicts"

This helped make our project history easy to understand and follow.

This project helped us improve both our technical GitHub skills and our understanding of Artificial Intelligence as a subject.
