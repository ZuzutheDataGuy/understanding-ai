# Chapter 1: What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, recognizing patterns, understanding language, making decisions, and adapting to new information. Although AI is often portrayed as futuristic, its foundations date back to the mid-20th century, and it has grown into one of the most influential technologies in the modern world.

In everyday life, many people already interact with AI through tools such as voice assistants (like Siri and Alexa), recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube and Netflix, social media feeds, email spam filters, and navigation apps such as Google Maps.

## 1.1 Background and Definition

The term *Artificial Intelligence* was coined in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference, where researchers proposed that human intelligence could be replicated by machines [1]. Since then, AI has evolved into a broad scientific discipline that integrates computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

AI can be broadly defined as **the ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions associated with the human mind**, such as perception, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving [2]. For a deeper understanding of learning systems, see Chapter 3: [Key Concepts](../concepts/chapter3-key-concepts.md).

## 1.2 Types of Artificial Intelligence

AI is commonly categorized into two major levels:

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)

Narrow AI is built to perform a specific task. It is the form of AI used today. Examples include:

- Virtual assistants (e.g. chatbots and smart speakers)  
- Recommendation engines (e.g. Netflix and YouTube suggestions)  
- Fraud detection systems used by banks  
- Image classification models used in photo apps  

Narrow AI does not possess consciousness or general reasoning abilities.

### General AI (Strong AI)

General AI is a theoretical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence. Such a system would be able to:

- Learn any intellectual task  
- Reason abstractly  
- Transfer knowledge across domains  

General AI does not exist yet and remains an ongoing research goal [3].

## 1.3 Core Characteristics of AI Systems

AI systems typically share several key capabilities:

- **Learning:** Ability to improve performance through experience (machine learning)  
- **Perception:** Interpreting sensory data such as images, audio, or text  
- **Reasoning:** Drawing conclusions and making informed decisions  
- **Problem-solving:** Identifying solutions to complex tasks  
- **Adaptability:** Adjusting behavior based on new information  

These capabilities enable AI systems to function effectively across dynamic and uncertain environments. These ideas are explored further in Chapter 3: [Key Concepts](../concepts/chapter3-key-concepts.md).

## 1.4 AI vs. Human Intelligence

While AI can outperform humans in speed, accuracy, and scale, it lacks uniquely human qualities:

- Emotional understanding  
- Creativity (in the human sense)  
- Moral reasoning  
- Common sense  
- Consciousness  

AI systems operate through algorithms and data, not intuition or lived experiences. Therefore, AI should be viewed as a powerful tool that complements rather than replaces human intelligence.

## 1.5 Applications of Artificial Intelligence

AI is deeply integrated into modern life and industry. Major application areas include:

- **Healthcare:** Disease detection, medical imaging analysis  
- **Finance:** Fraud detection, algorithmic trading  
- **Transport:** Autonomous vehicles, traffic prediction  
- **Retail:** Customer analytics, supply chain optimization  
- **Education:** Personalized learning systems  
- **Cybersecurity:** Threat detection and automated defense  

To explore real-world uses of AI in more detail, see Chapter 5: [AI Applications](../concepts/chapter5-ai-applications.md).

## 1.6 Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence is a transformative field that is reshaping nearly every sector of society. From simple automation to advanced learning systems, AI continues to push the boundaries of what machines can achieve. Understanding AI's foundations is essential before exploring deeper topics such as machine learning, deep learning, and ethics in later chapters.
